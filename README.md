# Forecasting American Energy Trends
Predicting American energy trends during decarbonisation using linear regression, generalized additive models and weighted least squares

## Data
"Our World in Data"
Ritchie, Hannah, et al.
https://github.com/owid/energy-data

This dataset contains electricity 
consumption figures extracted from the BP Statistical 
Review of World Energy, Shift Data Portal, and Ember.

## Methods
1. Ordinary linear regression
2. Generalized additive model
3. Weighted least squares

## Results
The final weighted least squares model indicates 
that, adjusting for all other predictors, a 1 year increase is 
associated with a 12.5962 terawatt-hour increase in output 
from solar power. Equivalently, adjusting for all other 
predictors, a 1 year increase is associated with a 22.402 
terawatt-hour increase in output from wind power. Assuming 
all fossil fuel electricity sources fall to zero output by 2035 
and assuming all other energy sources maintain constant output,
the increases in wind and solar output would not even 
be enough to cover todayâ€™s energy needs.
